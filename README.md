# Workday Timesheet Filler #

This script fills timesheets in Workday. It is very crude and still requires non-trivial amount of manual work. Use at your own risk.

## How to use ##

Install into Tampermonkey. Then, a black “Fill” button appears in the top-left corner of the Workday app.

From the Homepage:

1. Press “Time”.
2. Press “This Week”
3. Open “Enter Time”
4. Select “Quick Add”
5. Press “Next”
6. Press “Fill”

Wait a bit for the automation to take place. Then, press “OK”.
